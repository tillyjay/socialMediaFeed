# socialMediaFeed
*This repository only contains certain PHP files and not entire project, excluding such files as models, controllers, migrations, and seeders.*

This application is a dynamic social media feed with different users who each had unique administrative permissions for the feed, such as the ability to add users, or moderate posts.

Based off an ERD connected to a dynamic MySQL database, a customizable interface was created using Php and the Laravel framework. The application also included a touch of JavaScript for form validation and was styled using the Bootstrap framework.

This application pushed me out of my comfort zone by combining various techniques and frameworks. It was really cool to work with not only front-end code, but also pull back and work with back-end development.
